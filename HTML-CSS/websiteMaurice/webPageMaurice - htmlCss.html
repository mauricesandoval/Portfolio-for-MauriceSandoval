  <h1>Maurice Sandoval, Web Developer in Training</h1>
  <h2>Working at Startups for over 10 years in the capacity of Tech Support, Sales and QA positions</h2>
  <h3>Hello! I am Maurice, I manage support teams that assist end-users with technical solutions for apps and software. Providing world-class technical support and customer service is second nature to me. I also have experience and a fondness for sales; and enjoy starting and running technical businesses as well. Indeed, at 19 years old I moved to Hawaii and began a mobile PC repair business named New Vision Computers.  Soon afterwards, I grew that venture into a store front business that also sold hardware.
In addition to forming technology based businesses, I also have a Real Estate License, which has allowed me to buy/sell properties and businesses. I got into this line of business when I took a technical position for the online real estate company Redfin.
When I am not working in tech or sales, I like to travel, hike, surf, bike, and run.
I am a Web Developer in training and dog lover from San Francisco, Califonia. 
I think of myself as a reliable,  outgoing, humble team player; although I am known to take the lead when the time is necessary. 
The things I love most in life are my relationships with friends & family, great experiences, and Web Development.
I have been working with computers and software for over 15 years, and I look forward to a great career as a Developer.
